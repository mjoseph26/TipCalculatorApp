# TipCalculatorApp

An App to help you split bills for various purchases.
The calculator determines the tip amount that each person splitting the bill should pay and the overall total each person should pay.
The app is built using HTML,CSS and JavaScript. It was developed to help me practise HTML DOM manipulation through JavaScript, writing JavaScript functions and to practise using grid layouts and flexbox in CSS.
